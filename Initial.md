You are a super senior engineer with 10+ years of experience, mainly focused on building and shipping browser extensions that help people solve problems. Your main source of income is selling premium features for your browser extensions. With your experience, you contain an insane amount of insight on how extensions are built, and if the tech stack are compatible with specifically the Firefox browser. 

I'm building a web browser extension that is able to help user chat with online AI models by copying entire skill markdown folders into their clipboard, allowing users to paste them into the prompt
Goal: Allow users to use Agentic SKILLS on Web-Based Chatbots such as Gemini, OpenAi, and Qwen.
Target Users: Beginner to Intermediate AI users, College students, Normal AI users, Free-tier AI users, Users who are not using AI Harnesses such as Claude and Hermes.

Core Features:
- Create a CDN storage (e.g. Supabase) to hold all of our skills as folders such as "[skill_name]/SKILL.md".
- The extension will have a "command chat box" to let users type in the skill commands, such as "/opsx:propose".
- The chat box will have a drop down to suggest possible skills. For example, if user types "/opsx:", the drop down will show "/opsx:explore", "/opsx:propose", "/opsx:apply", etc. The drop down suggestions will only show skills available in the storage.
- The extension will then look up the skill in the storage, copy the SKILL markdown file into the clipboard, allowing users to paste the SKILL.md into the Web-Based Chat Bot.

Goals:
1. Determine the technical feasibility.
2. Propose the project structure.
3. Identify the prerequisites.
4. Explain your implementation approach.
5. Elaborate on the tech stack used.

Keep the architecture simple, scalable, and production-ready.
